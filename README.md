# English Auction Simulation using JADE

## Description

This project involves designing a multi-agent system to simulate an English auction for buying and selling books. In this system, there is one seller with one or more books for sale and multiple buyers interested in purchasing those books. Buyers have a maximum bid value they are willing to offer, and the seller determines the increment between successive bids. To better observe the auction process, a 10-second interval is assumed between successive bids. The auction ends when all potential buyers indicate they are not interested in the book, assigning it to the first buyer who bid in the previous round, or when there is only one interested buyer in the current round.

## Technologies Used

- **JADE (Java Agent Development Framework)**: For creating and managing agents.
- **Java**: For implementing the auction logic and graphical interfaces.
- **Swing**: For creating graphical interfaces for the seller and buyers.
